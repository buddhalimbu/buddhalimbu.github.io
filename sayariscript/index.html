<div class="sayari">I hope that one day my weakly Heart will forget you.</div>

                <div class="sayari">No matter what , I can break myself thousands of times just for you.</div>

                <div class="sayari">Even if we are separated , waiting will be your till last breathe.</div>

                <div class="sayari">I just couldn't show you, How many nights i cried for you.</div>

                <div class="sayari">I don't know but I can't sleep at night without talking with you.</div>

                <div class="sayari">A home where love, harmony and hospitality are found is a real home.</div>

                <div class="sayari">
                    How good it feels when someone says - don't worry, I am with you.
                </div>

                <div class="sayari">
                    Intending to build a world of love, the contractors were found to be expensive.
                </div>

                <div class="sayari">
                    Nothing is yours at will, Not every smile is happy, The heart is hungry for love, But sometimes time and sometimes fate is not right.
                </div>

                <div class="sayari">
                    Before you hurt someone's heart, remember one thing, God shas given you a heart too.
                </div>

                <div class="sayari">
                    Eyes have the most sweetest relationship, They open together and close together.
                </div>

                <div class="sayari">
                    Do not love someone so much that later you will find it difficult to control yourself.
                </div>

                <div class="sayari">
                    When a new person enters the life, the importance of the old person will be decreasing.
                </div>

                <div class="sayari">
                    The day you forget me, remember! You lost a loved one.
                </div>

                <div class="sayari">
                    Once you were the reason for my laughter, today you are also the reason for my tears.
                </div>

                <div class="sayari">
                    Now you don't feel my love but one day realize I won't be close to you...
                </div>
